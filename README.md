An opinionated fork of [badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) that turns the coding agent into **senpi**: a senpai-name pun, and a more sane pi with extra batteries included.

> **Upstream**: [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) by [@mariozechner](https://github.com/badlogic) -- tools for building AI agents and managing LLM deployments.

## What This Fork Adds

## Why "senpi"

`senpi` is a small joke on **senpai**, but it is also literal project positioning: this fork aims to be a more **sane** pi with practical additions that make everyday agent work smoother without abandoning upstream's core design.

All additions follow pi's extension-first philosophy. Core source modifications are minimized and [documented in `changes.md` files](#fork-strategy) to keep upstream rebases clean.

### Dynamic System Prompt

Replaces pi's static system prompt with a prompt that adapts to the current tool set and session context.

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intent Gate** | Forces the model to classify user intent (research / implementation / investigation / evaluation / fix / open-ended) and verbalize its routing decision before acting. Prevents the model from jumping straight into edits on ambiguous requests. |
| **Tool Categorization** | Groups registered tools by type (LSP, AST, search, session, command) and generates a categorized tool reference with per-tool snippets and usage guidelines. |
| **Policy Enforcement** | Injects language-agnostic hard blocks (no unauthorized git commits, no speculation about unread code, no suppression of type/lint/test failures) and anti-patterns (no deleted failing tests, no silently swallowed errors, no shotgun debugging) directly into the prompt so models self-enforce code quality rules. |

### Builtin Extension System

A new extension loading tier that ships first-party extensions as part of the coding agent binary. These load automatically without requiring files in `.senpi/extensions/` or `~/.senpi/agent/extensions/`.

**Core builtins** (always loaded):

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **todowrite** | Structured task management. Adds `todowrite` and `todoread` tools with a TUI sidebar widget. Enforces WHERE/WHY/HOW/RESULT format for each todo item. Injects task management rules into the system prompt via `before_agent_start`. |
| **openai-api-parallel-tool-calls** | Intercepts OpenAI provider requests and adds `parallel_tool_calls: true` to payloads when tools are present. Covers `openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, `openai-codex-responses`, and `azure-openai-responses` APIs. Also injects an Execution Strategy section into the system prompt that describes parallelization and context-breadth guidance without hardcoding specific tool names. |
| **redraws** | Adds `/tui` command to display full-redraw count for TUI debugging. |
| **bash-timeout** | Applies a default timeout (120s) to every `bash` tool call when the model omits one and caps over-generous timeouts at a maximum (600s). Mirrors free-code's behavior. Configurable via `PI_BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `PI_BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Injects a system-prompt rider so the model knows the active limits. |

**Global defaults** (seeded to `~/.senpi/agent/extensions/` on first run):

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **diff** | `/diff` command. Shows modified/deleted/new files from `git status` with colored status indicators. Selecting a file opens VS Code's diff view. |
| **files** | `/files` command. Lists all files the model has read/written/edited in the current session branch, coalesced by path and sorted newest-first. Opens selected file in VS Code. |
| **prompt-url-widget** | Detects GitHub PR/issue URLs in prompts, fetches metadata via `gh` CLI, and displays a title/author widget. Auto-sets the session name from the PR/issue. |
| **tps** | Displays tokens-per-second stats (input, output, cache read/write) as a notification after each agent turn. |

### Other Changes

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **`senpi` CLI branding** | The coding agent now identifies itself as `senpi`, uses `.senpi/agent` for config storage, and publishes as `@code-yeongyu/senpi`. |
| **No startup update checks** | Removed npm registry version checking and package update prompts at launch. |
| **Builtin extension UI grouping** | Builtin extensions render under a separate `builtin/` group in the startup header, visually distinct from user and project extensions. |
| **Updated model registry** | Refreshed `models.generated.ts` with latest model additions and deprecations. |

## Fork Strategy

This fork rebases periodically on `upstream/main`. To minimize merge conflicts:

1. **Extension-first**: All features use pi's [extension system](packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md) as builtin extensions.
2. **Document core changes**: Every upstream file modification has a corresponding `changes.md` in the affected subdirectory, documenting what changed, why, and expected conflict zones.
3. **Remotes**: `origin` = [code-yeongyu/sanepi-mono](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/sanepi-mono), `upstream` = [badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

Modified upstream files:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agent-session.ts` | Calls `buildDynamicSystemPrompt()` instead of `buildSystemPrompt()` |
| `resource-loader.ts` | Removed SYSTEM.md/APPEND_SYSTEM.md discovery; added builtin extension loading |
| `interactive-mode.ts` | Builtin extension display formatting; disabled update checks |
| `package.json` | Rebranded the coding agent package and runtime identity to `senpi` |

## Share your OSS coding agent sessions

If you use pi or other coding agents for open source work, please share your sessions.

Public OSS session data helps improve coding agents with real-world tasks, tool use, failures, and fixes instead of toy benchmarks.

For the full explanation, see [this post on X](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2037811643774652911).

To publish sessions, use [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf). Read its README.md for setup instructions. All you need is a Hugging Face account, the Hugging Face CLI, and `pi-share-hf`.

You can also watch [this video](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2041151967695634619), where I show how I publish my `pi-mono` sessions.

I regularly publish my own `pi-mono` work sessions here:

## Packages

| Package | Description |

| **[@mariozechner/pi-ai](packages/ai)** | Unified multi-provider LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) |
| **[@mariozechner/pi-agent-core](packages/agent)** | Agent runtime with tool calling and state management |
| **[@code-yeongyu/senpi](packages/coding-agent)** | Interactive coding agent CLI, rebranded as senpi |
| **[@mariozechner/pi-tui](packages/tui)** | Terminal UI library with differential rendering |
| **[@mariozechner/pi-web-ui](packages/web-ui)** | Web components for AI chat interfaces |

## Chat bot workflows

For Slack/chat automation, see [earendil-works/pi-chat](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-chat).

## Development

```bash
npm install          # Install all dependencies
npm run build        # Build all packages (dependency order)
npm run check        # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh            # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)
```

> `npm run check` requires `npm run build` first. The web-ui package uses `tsc` which needs compiled `.d.ts` files from dependencies.

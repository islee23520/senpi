# Core Extensions Changes

## 2026-05-08 - Generated Default Extension Factory Resolver

### What changed

- `loader.ts`: `loadExtensions()` now accepts an optional factory resolver and creates the jiti importer lazily only when an extension path is not resolved to a known factory.
- `builtin/index.ts`: Exposes a keyed map for the four global default extension factories used by generated shims.

### Why

- The default global extension shim files are deterministic. Letting core resolve those shims to known factories avoids the jiti import path without changing extension order, source paths, or behavior for custom extension files.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Extension loading is core infrastructure; extensions cannot intercept the module importer before their factories have been loaded.

### Files modified

- `loader.ts`
- `builtin/index.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- MEDIUM: `loader.ts` around `loadExtension()` and `loadExtensions()` signatures/importer construction.
- LOW: `builtin/index.ts` around global default extension registration.

## 2026-05-08 - Shared Jiti Extension Importer

### What changed

- `loader.ts`: Reuses one `jiti` importer across each `loadExtensions()` batch while keeping `moduleCache: false` for reload freshness.
- `loader.ts`: Aliases upstream `@mariozechner/pi-*` peer imports to the already-loaded senpi workspace packages.

### Why

- Startup was spending several seconds creating a fresh `jiti` instance for every configured extension, causing repeated TypeScript/dependency resolution work before the first TUI frame.
- Installed pi extensions still import upstream `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, `pi-ai`, and `pi-tui` peer names. Without aliases, jiti can fall through to each extension's own `node_modules` and load a duplicate pi runtime.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Extension loading is core infrastructure; extensions cannot change how the core loader imports extension modules.

### Files modified

- `loader.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- MEDIUM: `loader.ts` around `loadExtensionModule()`, `loadExtension()`, and `loadExtensions()` importer construction.

## 2026-04-30 - Model Switch System Prompt Change Event

### What changed

- `types.ts`: Added `ModelSelectEventResult` and `SystemPromptChangeEvent`, plus `pi.on("system_prompt_change", ...)` typing.
- `runner.ts`: Added `emitModelSelect()` so `model_select` handlers can request an active system prompt replacement.
- `builtin/prompt-preset/index.ts`: Returns the resolved prompt preset during `model_select`, including fallback reset when no preset applies.

### Why

- Prompt presets previously updated the system prompt only at `before_agent_start`, so a mid-session model switch did not immediately update the active prompt or expose a typed event for observers.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Extensions could listen to `model_select`, but the runner ignored handler return values and there was no typed `pi.on` event for the resulting system prompt change.

### Files modified

- `types.ts`
- `runner.ts`
- `builtin/prompt-preset/index.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `types.ts` around model/agent event unions and `ExtensionAPI.on` overloads.
- HIGH: `runner.ts` around event emission helpers.

### Migration notes

- Preserve the invariant that `system_prompt_change` fires only after the active prompt string actually changes.

## 2026-04-28 - Compaction Settings Context API

### What changed

- `types.ts`: Added `ExtensionContext.getCompactionSettings()` and matching `ExtensionContextActions.getCompactionSettings`.
- `runner.ts`: Wired the new context action through `bindCore()` and `createContext()`.
- `agent-session.ts`: Bound the context action to `settingsManager.getCompactionSettings()`.
- `interactive-mode.ts`: Added the same method to inline shortcut `ExtensionContext` construction.

### Why

- The builtin compaction extension previously used `DEFAULT_COMPACTION_SETTINGS`, which bypassed user/project settings such as `compaction.enabled: false`.
- Plugsuit-style threshold realignment needs resolved settings for speculative toggles, cooldowns, keep-recent caps, and restoration budgets.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Extensions receive `ExtensionContext`, not the core `SettingsManager`; without a typed context method, builtin extensions cannot read the already-merged global/project/user compaction settings.

### Files modified

- `types.ts`
- `runner.ts`
- `agent-session.ts`
- `interactive-mode.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `types.ts` and `runner.ts` around `ExtensionContext`/`ExtensionContextActions` definitions and context construction.
- HIGH: `interactive-mode.ts` shortcut context literals must retain parity with `ExtensionRunner.createContext()`.

### Migration notes

- If upstream adds settings access to `ExtensionContext`, keep this method or map the builtin compaction extension to the upstream equivalent. The required invariant is that compaction policy uses resolved settings, never hardcoded defaults.

## 2026-04-27 - Seam 3: Compaction Apply Context API

### What changed

- `types.ts`: Added `ApplyCompactionOptions`, `ApplyCompactionResult`, `ExtensionContext.getMessageRevision()`, and `ExtensionContext.applyCompaction()`.
- `runner.ts`: Wired the new context actions through `bindCore()` and `createContext()` so extensions can read the current message revision and apply a precomputed compaction result.
- `interactive-mode.ts`: Added the same methods to the inline shortcut `ExtensionContext` literal.

### Why

- Speculative/v2 compaction needs a stable compare-and-apply seam: extensions can prepare a compaction summary against revision N and only apply it if no context-affecting message mutation has happened since.
- `getMessageRevision()` is intentionally monotonic and in-memory only; it is a staleness guard, not persisted session data.
- `applyCompaction()` returns explicit `ok`, `stale`, or `rejected` outcomes so extensions can avoid racing the live session.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

Extensions can observe hooks and return summaries during a core-driven compaction, but they cannot append a compaction entry, rebuild agent context, emit core compaction events, or atomically guard against stale session context without a typed core API.

### Files modified

- `types.ts`
- `runner.ts`
- `interactive-mode.ts`
- `agent-session.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `types.ts` and `runner.ts` around `ExtensionContext`/`ExtensionContextActions` definitions and context construction.
- HIGH: `interactive-mode.ts` shortcut context literals must retain parity with `ExtensionRunner.createContext()`.

### Migration notes

If upstream adds new `ExtensionContext` methods or changes `AgentSession` message mutation logic, preserve the monotonic revision counter and the `applyCompaction()` compare-and-apply semantics. The revision guard must remain in-memory and advance on every context-affecting mutation. Do not let upstream's `ExtensionContext` additions shadow the new methods.

## 2026-04-27 - Seam 1: Compaction Event Metadata

### What changed

- `types.ts` line ~85: Added `CompactionReason` and `CompactionRejectionCause` exported literal-union aliases.
- `types.ts` lines ~541-554: Added `reason`, `willRetry`, and `requestId` metadata to `SessionBeforeCompactEvent`.
- `types.ts` lines ~549-554: Added `reason`, `requestId`, `accepted`, and optional `rejectionCause` metadata to `SessionCompactEvent`.
- `agent-session.ts` lines ~1651, ~1713, ~1910, and ~1986: Populated the 4 existing compaction event construction sites with the new required metadata fields. T15 will refactor these construction sites into the unified `_executeCompaction()` pipeline. T13 only populates the new required fields with minimal correct values to keep tsgo passing.

### Why

- Extensions cannot safely apply route-specific policies such as cooldown scope or circuit-breaker counters without knowing the compaction source.
- The user explicitly required consistency across the 6 compaction routes; this metadata is the prerequisite.
- `reason` always preserves the route source, while `rejectionCause` explains why a compaction was rejected when `accepted` is false.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

Event payloads are core-defined types. Extensions can consume compaction events, but they cannot add typed fields to those events from outside the core extension API.

### Files modified

- `types.ts`
- `agent-session.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `types.ts` is high-churn upstream, especially around extension event definitions. Resolution: preserve additive compaction metadata and keep `reason` semantically separate from `rejectionCause`.

### Migration notes

If upstream modifies compaction event definitions in `types.ts`, preserve the additive metadata fields (`reason`, `willRetry`, `requestId`, `accepted`, `rejectionCause`) and keep them semantically separate from upstream's existing fields. Update the 4 event construction sites in `agent-session.ts` to populate the new fields with the correct route-specific values.

## 2026-04-13 - GPT apply_patch builtin support

### What changed and why

- Added builtin `gpt-apply-patch` extension support so OpenAI GPT sessions can swap `write`/`edit` for a Codex-style `apply_patch` tool and react to mid-session model changes.
- Extended extension/tool plumbing to carry OpenAI Responses freeform grammar metadata. This core change was necessary because the existing extension API only modeled JSON-schema function tools, which made exact Codex GPT `apply_patch` parity impossible from an extension alone.

### Files modified

- `types.ts`
- `builtin/index.ts`
- `builtin/gpt-apply-patch/index.ts` (vendored from `pi-apply-patch`)

### Why the extension system couldn't handle this alone

- `ToolDefinition` had no way to express freeform grammar tools, only JSON-schema parameters.
- Wrapper plumbing dropped any provider-specific tool metadata before requests reached `pi-ai`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `types.ts` around `ToolDefinition`
- `builtin/index.ts` builtin registration ordering

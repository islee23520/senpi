# Changes

## 2026-04-05 - Parallel tool completion emission

### What changed and why

- Updated `executeToolCallsParallel()` to finalize prepared tool calls concurrently after sequential preflight.
- This lets `tool_execution_end` and `toolResult` message events appear as soon as each tool finishes instead of waiting behind an earlier slow tool.
- The returned `toolResults` array still stays in assistant source order, which preserves next-turn context ordering and matches existing semantic expectations.

### Files modified

- `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts`
- `packages/agent/src/types.ts`
- `packages/agent/README.md`
- `packages/agent/test/agent-loop.test.ts`

### Why the extension system could not handle this

- The scheduling and final result collection logic lives in `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, specifically `executeToolCallsParallel()`.
- Coding-agent extensions can observe and mutate tool inputs/results, but they cannot replace the agent loop's internal await/collection strategy or `toolExecution` scheduling behavior.
- The existing builtin `parallel-tool-calls` extension only changes provider payloads (`parallel_tool_calls: true`) and does not control runtime result finalization.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts` around `executeToolCallsParallel()`
- `packages/agent/src/types.ts` tool execution mode docs
- `packages/agent/README.md` tool execution behavior description

## 2026-05-11 - Inline harness UUIDv7 generation

### What changed and why

- Replaced upstream harness imports of `uuid/v7` with a local UUIDv7 generator backed by Node's `crypto.randomBytes`.
- This keeps clean package-manager builds working without adding a new direct `uuid` dependency to `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`.

### Files modified

- `packages/agent/src/harness/session/repo/shared.ts`
- `packages/agent/src/harness/session/storage/memory.ts`

### Why the extension system could not handle this

- The failing imports live inside the agent harness session storage implementation and run before any coding-agent extension can intercept them.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- `packages/agent/src/harness/session/repo/shared.ts` around session id creation.
- `packages/agent/src/harness/session/storage/memory.ts` around default metadata initialization.

## 2026-05-11 - Harness ES2021 diagnostic compatibility

### What changed and why

- Replaced `ErrorOptions`/two-argument `Error` construction in `FileError` with an equivalent local `{ cause }`
  option stored on the class.
- Replaced `Object.hasOwn` with `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` in the stream option patch helper.
- This keeps the upstream harness behavior intact while avoiding diagnostics in environments that type-check the package with
  ES2021 library declarations.

### Files modified

- `packages/agent/src/harness/types.ts`
- `packages/agent/src/harness/agent-harness.ts`

### Why the extension system could not handle this

- These are type-level compatibility fixes in exported harness primitives and internal option-merging code that run before
  coding-agent extensions are involved.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- `packages/agent/src/harness/types.ts` around `FileError` construction.
- `packages/agent/src/harness/agent-harness.ts` around `hasOwn()`.

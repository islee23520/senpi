## 2026-07-22 - Drop tool results of errored/aborted assistants in transformMessages

### What changed and why

- `api/transform-messages.ts`: the pairing pass now records the toolCall ids of every assistant it skips
  because `stopReason === "error" | "aborted"` into `droppedCallIds` (mirroring the existing skip condition),
  and the emit loop no longer emits a toolResult whose `toolCallId` is in that set — unless the id is also
  declared by a kept assistant (`nextToolCallIndexById`), which still pairs through the normal windows.
  Previously the errored assistant was dropped while its result (a real one, or a placeholder synthesized by
  the compaction pipeline's `repairOrphanedToolResults`) survived, so the request carried a `role:"tool"`
  message whose `tool_call_id` no assistant declared; strict providers (apitopia/kimi openai-completions)
  reject it with `400 tool_call_id ... is not found`, permanently bricking compaction for the session.
  True orphans (id declared nowhere) and results of kept assistants are unchanged, and kept assistants'
  unanswered calls still get the synthetic "No result provided" result.
- `utils/tool-pair-repair.ts`: `repairOrphanedToolResults` no longer synthesizes placeholder results for
  toolCalls declared by errored/aborted assistants (defense in depth; those assistants are dropped by
  `transformMessages` anyway). The coding-agent compaction copy received the identical guard; the two
  files remain verbatim copies.
- `../test/transform-messages-errored-tool-results.test.ts`: drop cases (errored + real result, aborted +
  synthesized placeholder), preservation cases (kept pair, "No result provided" synthesis, true orphan
  passthrough), and an id re-declared by a later kept assistant. `../test/tool-pair-repair.test.ts`: no
  synthesis for errored/aborted assistants, synthesis kept for a kept re-declaration.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `api/transform-messages.ts` second-pass pairing loop and toolResult emit branch;
  `utils/tool-pair-repair.ts` dangling-call synthesis loop.

## 2026-07-21 - OpenAI Responses provider-native completion reconciliation

### What changed and why

- `api/openai-responses-shared.ts`: opaque output items now occupy the existing output-index slot map, so
  `response.output_item.done` replaces the partial `added` payload with the final provider item. OpenAI web-search
  actions commonly arrive only on the done frame; retaining the added placeholder lost the final query/action before
  session persistence and app-server projection.
- `../test/openai-responses.provider-native.test.ts`: covers an action-less added web-search item followed by the
  completed done item.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `api/openai-responses-shared.ts` output-slot creation and `response.output_item.done` finalization.

## 2026-07-22 - Omit non-"fc" item ids when replaying tool calls as function_call

- `api/openai-responses-shared.ts` `convertResponsesMessages()`: a `function_call` input
  item's `id` is now emitted only when it begins with "fc" — the Responses API rejects
  anything else (`Invalid 'input[N].id': 'custom'. Expected an ID that begins with 'fc'.`).
  Custom tool calls are stored with the `<call_id>|custom` sentinel (a `custom_tool_call`
  output carries no server-issued item id), so replaying them without their freeform tool
  registered — compaction summarization strips `freeform` from its tool list — previously
  sent `id: "custom"` and hard-failed the whole request, tripping the compaction circuit
  breaker. Omitting mirrors the existing different-model pairing-validation skip;
  server-issued `fc_…` ids still replay unchanged.
- `../test/openai-responses-custom-tools.test.ts`: sentinel omission plus a pin that
  genuine `fc` ids survive same-model replay.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `convertResponsesMessages` function_call emission branch.

## 2026-07-20 - Typed classifier stop details

- Added optional typed refusal/sensitive stop details to assistant messages, preserving Anthropic classifier outcomes through streaming and faux provider errors.
- Exported `isClassifierRefusal` and excluded classifier outcomes from generic same-model retry classification.


## 2026-07-20 - Live tool-result pairing by source position + Retry unsigned Anthropic thinking replay as text

### What changed and why

#### Live tool-result pairing by source position

- `api/transform-messages.ts`: live history normalization now indexes tool results and replayable tool calls by
  source position. Each tool call consumes the earliest still-unconsumed matching result after its declaring
  assistant, emits that result adjacent to the assistant turn, or emits exactly one synthetic error result.
  A repeated ID establishes a new pairing window, so a delayed result cannot attach to an earlier call or be
  replayed twice across an intervening user turn. Aborted and errored assistant turns remain excluded.
- `../test/transform-messages-copilot-openai-to-anthropic.test.ts`: covers delayed normalized results across a
  user turn, partial multi-call results, reused IDs with prior orphaned results, trailing unresolved calls, and
  Anthropic-required tool-result adjacency.

#### Retry unsigned Anthropic thinking replay as text

- `AnthropicMessagesCompat.unsignedThinkingReplay` now explicitly controls replay of thinking blocks without a usable signature. The safe default is text replay for first-party/signing endpoints; the legacy `allowEmptySignature` flag remains an alias for Kimi-compatible empty-signature replay.
- When an endpoint rejects an empty replay signature with a pre-stream HTTP 400 containing `Invalid signature in thinking block`, the Anthropic adapter rebuilds the request with unsigned thinking demoted to text and retries exactly once. That learned fallback is scoped to the session, base URL, and model ID, without mutating shared `Model` metadata.
- Signed and redacted thinking replay remains byte-for-byte/native-state preserving. Non-signature 400s and errors after SSE content begins do not retry.

### Files modified

- `api/transform-messages.ts`
- `../test/transform-messages-copilot-openai-to-anthropic.test.ts`
- `types.ts`
- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-unsigned-thinking-replay.test.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `api/transform-messages.ts` second-pass tool-result normalization.
- LOW: `AnthropicMessagesCompat` replay options and Anthropic request creation.
## 2026-07-17 - Video input modality for Kimi K3 (kimi-coding)

### What changed and why

- `types.ts`: `Model.input` union gains `"video"`. No new message content type: video payloads ride the
  existing `ImageContent` block with a `video/*` mimeType (helper `isVideoMimeType()` exported) to keep the
  message contract and the upstream merge surface unchanged.
- `api/transform-messages.ts`: `downgradeUnsupportedImages` now first replaces video-mime blocks with a
  placeholder for models without the `"video"` modality (user and toolResult content), then applies the
  existing image downgrade. Prevents cross-model replay from sending video blocks to providers that reject
  them.
- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`: `convertContentBlocks` and the user-message block mapping serialize
  video-mime blocks as `{type:"video", source:{type:"base64", media_type, data}}` — the wire shape the
  Kimi Anthropic-compatible endpoint accepts (verified against MoonshotAI/kimi-code kosong anthropic
  provider). The block is not in the official SDK union, so it is cast like the existing `tool_reference`
  escape hatch.
- `scripts/generate-models.ts` + regenerated `providers/kimi-coding.models.ts`: kimi-coding `k3` declares
  `input: ["text", "image", "video"]`.

### Files modified

- `types.ts`
- `api/transform-messages.ts`
- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`
- `../scripts/generate-models.ts`
- `providers/kimi-coding.models.ts` (generated)
- `../test/transform-messages-video.test.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `types.ts` `Model.input` union and `ImageContent` comment.
- MEDIUM: `api/anthropic-messages.ts` `convertContentBlocks` / `convertToolResult` if upstream reworks
  content serialization.
- LOW: `api/transform-messages.ts` `downgradeUnsupportedImages`.

## 2026-07-19 - Name-preserving apply_patch replay characterization and policy coverage

### What changed and why

- Added characterization + policy-table coverage for replaying mixed edit/apply_patch
  history across every KnownApi: Responses targets serialize a historical apply_patch call
  as `custom_tool_call` when a freeform apply_patch is declared and as `function_call`
  (name preserved, JSON `{input}` args) otherwise; Completions/Anthropic/Google/Bedrock/
  Mistral/pi-messages keep the stored name with native JSON-typed call entries.
- No production change was required: existing converters already implement the
  name-preserving truth table. Tests pin both branches plus per-API shape assertions so a
  future regression cannot silently rename or drop historical patch calls.

## 2026-07-17 - Truncation-recovery contract for ToolCall and toolcall_end

### What changed and why

- Truncated text-protocol tool calls were silently dropped, leaked as raw markup, or executed from a
  stale argument snapshot, with no public signal distinguishing a finalized (executable) call from
  one the parser could only partially recover. Consumers had no contract for "this tool call is
  incomplete; do not execute it; ask the model to retry."
- `ToolCall` gains optional `incomplete?: true` and `errorMessage?: string`, set by the text tool-call
  middleware when a truncated call could not be recovered. Carriers of `incomplete` MUST NOT be
  executed; they are surfaced as a failed tool result so the model re-issues the call next turn.
- The `toolcall_end` member of `AssistantMessageEvent` is redefined from an implicit "complete" to
  "finalized": a `toolcall_end` is executable iff `incomplete !== true`. Flagged ends still terminate
  the call (so the wrapper never holds a dangling partial) but are not executable. This is the
  release-note surface for the redefinition.
- `ToolCallFormat` gains `"morph-xml"` as the canonical id; `"xml"` is retained as a deprecated alias
  resolving to the same protocol, so existing `models.json` configs and compiled consumers of
  `getProtocol("xml")` keep working without a runtime normalization that rewrites stored config
  values.
- Flagged dangling-call diagnostics always append `Re-issue the tool call with complete arguments.` to parser-provided error messages without duplicating a final period.
- `compat.ts` now publicly re-exports `getToolCallFormat`, `getProtocol`, `transformContext`, and `wrapStreamWithToolCallMiddleware` for composed providers that need the text tool-call middleware.

### Files modified

- `types.ts` (`ToolCall`, `AssistantMessageEvent.toolcall_end`, `OpenAICompletionsCompat.toolCallFormat` doc)
- `tool-call-middleware/types.ts`, `tool-call-middleware/index.ts`, `tool-call-middleware/context-transformer.ts`
- `../test/tool-call-middleware/context-transformer.test.ts`, `../test/tool-call-middleware/stream-integration.test.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone

- The canonical `ToolCall` shape, the `toolcall_end` event contract, and the `ToolCallFormat` union
  are all exported from `pi-ai` and consumed by standalone `pi-ai` clients before any coding-agent
  extension runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `types.ts` around the `ToolCall` and `AssistantMessageEvent` declarations.
- LOW: `tool-call-middleware/types.ts` `ToolCallFormat` union and `toolcall_end` variant.

## 2026-07-17 - Moonshot root object-union compatibility

### What changed and why

- `utils/tool-schema-compat.ts`: Moonshot normalization now flattens a root `anyOf`/`oneOf` of object parameter
  shapes into one `type: "object"` schema. Properties are merged and only branch-common required fields remain.
  Kimi rejects a root combiner without `type`, but also rejects a sibling root `type` beside that combiner, so the
  union must be represented as a permissive object at the function-parameter boundary.
- `../test/openai-completions-tool-schema-compat.test.ts`: covers the real `click`-style coordinate/index union and
  the final post-hook request payload.

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone

- The provider adapter owns the final wire schema after payload hooks and is the only layer shared by direct
  Moonshot requests and custom Moonshot-compatible gateways.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `utils/tool-schema-compat.ts` if upstream expands its provider-specific schema normalizers.

## 2026-07-17 - Final-boundary Moonshot tool schema normalization

### What changed and why

- `api/openai-completions.ts`: re-normalizes function tool parameter schemas after `onPayload` and immediately before
  the OpenAI SDK request. Payload hooks can replace or inject tools after the ordinary `convertTools` pass; those tools
  previously bypassed the Moonshot/MFJS compatibility transform and could retain a parent `type` beside `anyOf`, which
  Moonshot rejects with HTTP 400.
- `../test/openai-completions-tool-schema-compat.test.ts`: captures the real HTTP request and locks the post-hook wire
  shape.

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone

- `before_provider_request` is exposed through `onPayload`, so the provider adapter is the only layer that can validate
  the complete tool list after every hook has run.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `api/openai-completions.ts` around the `onPayload` callback and final request submission.

## 2026-07-16 - Anthropic native web_search endpoint guard and server_tool_use input streaming

### What changed and why

- `types.ts`: added `AnthropicMessagesCompat.supportsWebSearch`. Default (resolved in
  `getAnthropicCompat`): true only for the first-party `api.anthropic.com` endpoint; compatible providers and
  provider overrides can
  opt in per model via `compat`.
- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`: `sanitizeUnsupportedNativeTools` now also strips hook-injected native `web_search_*`
  tools when the resolved compat does not support them, mirroring the existing native computer tool guard and the
  OpenAI Responses `web_search_preview` compat guard (2026-05-15). Anthropic-compatible endpoints such as kimi-coding
  execute the server-side search but reject the replayed `server_tool_use` / `web_search_tool_result` blocks on the
  next request (kimi-coding 400s with `tool_call_id is not found`), wedging the session. Named `tool_choice` is
  preserved when a same-name function fallback remains and removed only when the retained tool list no longer
  contains that choice.
- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`: same-model provider-native replay also drops web-search server-tool blocks
  (`server_tool_use` named `web_search` and `web_search_tool_result`) when the endpoint lacks `supportsWebSearch`.
  Sessions that already recorded such blocks against an incompatible endpoint were permanently wedged — every
  request replayed the rejected blocks; dropping the pair loses the searched context but unwedges the session.
- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`: streaming now accumulates `input_json_delta` for Anthropic's confirmed
  provider-native tool-use blocks (`server_tool_use` and beta `mcp_tool_use`) and merges the parsed input into the stored raw block at
  `content_block_stop` (or in the abort/error finalizer for interrupted streams). Previously the block kept the
  `content_block_start` snapshot (`input: {}`), so every same-model replay sent the server tool call with an empty
  input. Unknown and result-shaped blocks are never touched; their raw provider payload must remain verbatim.

### Files modified

- `types.ts`
- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-native-web-search-compat.test.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-provider-native-replay.test.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-web-search-replay-encryption.test.ts`
- `../test/anthropic.provider-native.test.ts`
- (see also `../../coding-agent/src/core/changes.md` for the models.json compat schema entry)

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Extensions can inject native `web_search_*` tools via `before_provider_request`; the final payload is only known
  after all hooks run, so the provider is the last reliable guard before SDK submission (same rationale as the
  OpenAI Responses guard). Provider-native block capture during streaming happens inside `pi-ai` before any
  extension sees the message.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `api/anthropic-messages.ts` around `getAnthropicCompat`, `sanitizeUnsupportedNativeTools`, and the
  `content_block_delta` / `content_block_stop` streaming handlers.
- LOW: `types.ts` `AnthropicMessagesCompat` if upstream adds more compat flags.

## 2026-07-14 - Anthropic web search replay encrypted content correction

### What changed and why

- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`: same-model provider-native replay now preserves each nested `web_search_result` item's
  `encrypted_content` byte-for-byte before sending prior server-side web search results back in the next Anthropic
  request. The existing same-provider/api/model boundary, fallback pruning, and cross-model dropping behavior remain
  unchanged.
- Anthropic's current web-search contract requires `encrypted_content` to be passed back unmodified for multi-turn use.
  The July 8 stripping workaround was wrong under that contract: it discarded opaque provider-owned replay state after
  one observed 400, even though the raw session stored all seven encrypted fields and Senpi removed them during
  conversion.

### Files modified

- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-provider-native-replay.test.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-web-search-replay-encryption.test.ts`

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `api/anthropic-messages.ts` around `sanitizeReplayableAnthropicProviderNativeBlock` and the provider-native
  replay path.

## 2026-07-06 - Anthropic server-side fallback replay contract

### What changed and why

- The server-side fallback beta (`server-side-fallback-2026-06-01`) emits a `fallback` content block mid-response when
  the serving model falls back (e.g. a `claude-fable-5` refusal replaced by the fallback model). Three fixes
  (2026-07-02 → 2026-07-06) make replaying such turns conform to the beta's contract:
  - `fallback` was added to `REPLAYABLE_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER_NATIVE_TYPES`; dropping it on same-model replay mutated the
    latest assistant message's block sequence and the API rejected the next request of the turn with a 400
    `thinking … cannot be modified` error, wedging the session.
  - Blocks emitted before the final `fallback` marker belong to the discarded attempt and are now omitted on replay;
    replaying them verbatim left pre-boundary `tool_use` blocks without matching `tool_result`s, rejected with 400
    `tool_use ids were found without tool_result blocks`.
  - An unpaired pre-boundary `server_tool_use` (fallback interrupted the declined attempt before the server tool's
    result arrived) is also dropped; paired server-tool blocks and text still replay verbatim.

### Files modified

- `api/anthropic-messages.ts`
- `test/anthropic-provider-native-replay.test.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Provider-native block replay filtering happens inside the Anthropic message transformer before any coding-agent
  extension can rewrite provider payloads.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `api/anthropic-messages.ts` around `REPLAYABLE_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER_NATIVE_TYPES` and the assistant-turn
  replay/filter path.
- LOW: `test/anthropic-provider-native-replay.test.ts` fixtures if upstream restructures replay tests.

## 2026-07-02 - Upstream provider metadata and Codex SSE transport sync

### What changed and why

- `api/openai-codex-responses.ts`: accepted upstream zstd request-body compression for Codex Responses SSE while
  preserving the fork's senpi-branded Codex headers, stale response handling, service-tier support, and thinking support.
- `utils/oauth/device-code.ts` and `utils/oauth/github-copilot.ts`: accepted delayed GitHub Copilot device-code polling
  and related OAuth cleanup.
- Provider model catalogs were refreshed for Copilot, Fireworks, OpenCode, Cloudflare AI Gateway, Bedrock, and related
  providers while retaining fork-specific model capability metadata such as `supportsXhigh`.

### Files modified

- `api/openai-codex-responses.ts`
- `providers/amazon-bedrock.models.ts`
- `providers/cloudflare-ai-gateway.models.ts`
- `providers/fireworks.models.ts`
- `providers/github-copilot.models.ts`
- `providers/opencode-go.models.ts`
- `providers/opencode.models.ts`
- `utils/oauth/device-code.ts`
- `utils/oauth/github-copilot.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Codex SSE request compression, OAuth polling, and generated provider metadata all live inside `pi-ai` before
  coding-agent extensions can intercept a request or model catalog entry.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `api/openai-codex-responses.ts` around request body creation, zstd encoding, headers, and stream response
  handling.
- LOW: `utils/oauth/device-code.ts` around polling cadence and error handling.
- LOW: provider `*.models.ts` catalogs when upstream regenerates model metadata.

## 2026-05-19 - Cloudflare Anthropic computer tool guard

### What changed and why
- `providers/anthropic.ts`: Cloudflare Anthropic routes now strip hook-injected native `computer_*` tools after `onPayload`, while preserving supported native tools such as `bash_20250124` and `text_editor_20250124`.
- Computer-use beta request headers are removed only for routes/models that reject the native computer tool.
- Added a regression matching the CF runtime error where `computer_20250124` is not one of the accepted tool tags.

### Files modified
- `providers/anthropic.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-on-payload-headers.test.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The failing payload can be introduced by `before_provider_request`; the provider adapter is the final point that sees the complete Anthropic request before SDK submission.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: native-tool sanitization helpers near request metadata extraction.

## 2026-05-18 - Anthropic protected thinking replay

### What changed and why
- `providers/anthropic.ts`: signed Anthropic `thinking` replay now forwards the stored text exactly as-is instead of running it through local surrogate sanitization. Anthropic treats signed and redacted thinking blocks as protected replay state; rewriting them can make the next tool-result request fail with `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` modification errors.
- `providers/transform-messages.ts`: same-model preserved provider-state blocks are now copied rather than shared, and redacted thinking remains same-model only. Cross-model transforms still drop opaque redacted thinking state.
- Added regressions for signed thinking replay, redacted thinking replay, immutable same-model transforms, cross-model redacted thinking dropping, and retry context behavior after a failed assistant turn.

### Files modified
- `providers/anthropic.ts`
- `providers/transform-messages.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-thinking-disable.test.ts`
- `../test/transform-messages-copilot-openai-to-anthropic.test.ts`
- `../../coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/0000-anthropic-partial-thinking-replay.test.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- Anthropic protected thinking is serialized inside `pi-ai`'s provider adapter after history transformation. Extensions and coding-agent retry logic cannot safely repair a signed block once the provider has normalized or shared it.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `convertMessages()` signed/redacted thinking block serialization in `providers/anthropic.ts`.
- LOW: same-model `preserveProviderState` branches in `providers/transform-messages.ts`.

## 2026-05-15 - OpenAI Responses `web_search_preview` compat guard

### What changed and why
- `providers/openai-responses.ts`: after `onPayload` hooks run, custom OpenAI Responses endpoints now strip native `web_search_preview` / `web_search_preview_2025_03_11` tools, the matching `tool_choice`, and `web_search_call.action.sources` includes unless `compat.supportsWebSearchPreview` explicitly opts in. Official `api.openai.com` endpoints keep the existing default support.
- `types.ts`: added `OpenAIResponsesCompat.supportsWebSearchPreview` so custom providers can declare support when they really pass OpenAI-native Responses tools through.
- Added regression coverage for hook-injected native web search on a custom Responses endpoint and the explicit opt-in path.

### Files modified
- `providers/openai-responses.ts`
- `types.ts`
- `../test/openai-responses-web-search-compat.test.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- External or user extensions can add provider-native tools through `before_provider_request`; the final OpenAI Responses payload is only known after all hooks have run. The provider is the last reliable guard before SDK submission.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `streamOpenAIResponses()` request construction immediately after the `onPayload` callback.
- LOW: `OpenAIResponsesCompat` if upstream adds more Responses compatibility flags.

## 2026-05-15 - Opus 4.6/4.7 unsupported native computer tool guard

### What changed and why
- `providers/anthropic.ts`: after `onPayload` hooks run, Opus 4.6 and 4.7 requests now strip Anthropic's legacy native `computer_20250124` tool and remove `computer-use-2025-01-24` from hook-added `anthropic-beta` request headers.
- Added a regression to cover extension-style payload mutation where a native computer tool is injected alongside another supported native tool. The supported tool and remaining beta header survive; the Opus-rejected computer tool does not reach the SDK request body.

### Files modified
- `providers/anthropic.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-on-payload-headers.test.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- External or user extensions can add provider-native tools through `before_provider_request`; the final provider payload is only known after all hooks have run. The Anthropic provider is the last reliable guard before SDK submission.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `streamAnthropic()` request construction immediately after the `onPayload` callback.
- LOW: native-tool sanitization helpers near request metadata extraction.

## 2026-05-15 - Anthropic `onPayload` request headers

### What changed and why
- `providers/anthropic.ts`: when an `onPayload` hook returns request metadata fields (`headers` / `extra_body`), the provider now forwards string-valued `headers` through the Anthropic SDK request options and strips both metadata keys from the JSON request body.
- Added a regression test for native computer-use extensions that inject `computer_20250124` plus `anthropic-beta: computer-use-2025-01-24` from `before_provider_request`. Previously the tool reached Anthropic but the beta header did not, producing a 400 where `computer_20250124` was not among the accepted tool tags.

### Files modified
- `providers/anthropic.ts`
- `../test/anthropic-on-payload-headers.test.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- Extensions can mutate the provider payload via `before_provider_request`, but Anthropic SDK request headers are assembled inside `pi-ai`. The provider must explicitly lift hook-added header metadata into SDK request options after `onPayload` runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `streamAnthropic()` request construction around the `onPayload` callback and SDK `messages.create()` options.

## 2026-05-11 - Senpi-branded Codex originator and User-Agent

### What changed and why
- `providers/openai-codex-responses.ts` `buildBaseCodexHeaders()`: changed the hardcoded `originator: "pi"` and the `User-Agent: "pi (…)"` string to `"senpi"`. Upstream chose `"pi"` as the Codex CLI identity; this fork's identity is `senpi`.
- `utils/oauth/openai-codex.ts` `createAuthorizationFlow()`: changed the default `originator` parameter from `"pi"` to `"senpi"` and updated the JSDoc on `loginOpenAICodex` accordingly. Callers can still pass their own originator.

### Files modified
- `providers/openai-codex-responses.ts`
- `utils/oauth/openai-codex.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The originator + User-Agent headers are built inside `pi-ai`'s Codex header constructor before the request leaves the library. Coding-agent extensions cannot intercept the header construction step.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `buildBaseCodexHeaders()` body (3 lines) and the `originator` default parameter / JSDoc in `createAuthorizationFlow`.

## 2026-05-07 - Shared tool pair repair utility for compaction-safe histories

### What changed and why
- Added `utils/tool-pair-repair.ts` to centralize bidirectional `tool_use`/`tool_result` pairing repair in `pi-ai`.
- This supports both coding-agent builtin extensions and external `pi-ai` consumers that do not load coding-agent extensions.

### Files modified
- `utils/tool-pair-repair.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- Extension code alone is not available to standalone `pi-ai` consumers, so this shared history repair logic must live in `pi-ai`.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- None expected; this is a new additive utility file.

## 2026-04-13 - OpenAI Responses custom tool support for apply_patch

### What changed and why
- Added optional freeform grammar metadata to tool types.
- Updated OpenAI Responses request/history conversion to emit and preserve `custom` / `custom_tool_call` / `custom_tool_call_output` items for freeform tools. This was required to match Codex GPT `apply_patch` behavior instead of falling back to JSON function tools.

### Files modified
- `types.ts`
- `providers/openai-responses-shared.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- `pi-ai` only serialized tools as JSON function definitions for OpenAI Responses, so a builtin extension could not produce Codex-compatible freeform tools without core provider changes.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- `types.ts` tool model
- `providers/openai-responses-shared.ts` request/stream conversion paths

## 2026-04-17 - Claude Opus 4.7, `max` effort alignment, and extra-body pass-through

### What changed and why
- Added `claude-opus-4-7` to the Anthropic provider and its Bedrock cross-region profiles (`anthropic.*`, `us.*`, `eu.*`, `global.*`) so Opus 4.7 is available in the catalog and survives re-runs of `generate-models.ts`.
- Expanded `supportsXhigh()` to include `opus-4-7` / `opus-4.7` so the coding agent exposes `xhigh` for Opus 4.7 users.
- Expanded Anthropic adaptive thinking support (`supportsAdaptiveThinking`) and effort mapping (`mapThinkingLevelToEffort`) for Opus 4.7:
  - `xhigh` now maps to the native `"xhigh"` effort on Opus 4.7 (Anthropic's newest tier).
  - `xhigh` still maps to `"max"` on Opus 4.6 (Opus 4.6 doesn't support native `xhigh`).
  - Added explicit `"max"` to the effort type union for future use.
  - Cast through `{ output_config?: { effort: AnthropicEffort } }` while the @anthropic-ai/sdk upstream types still reject `"xhigh"`.
- Added `StreamOptions.extraBody` for pass-through custom body fields (matches opencode's provider `options`). Wired it through every builtin provider's payload builder (`anthropic`, `openai-responses`, `openai-completions`, `azure-openai-responses`, `openai-codex-responses`, `mistral`, `google`, `google-vertex`, `google-gemini-cli`, `amazon-bedrock`). A shared `applyExtraBody` helper and per-provider reserved-key sets live in `providers/simple-options.ts` to prevent users from overriding provider-managed fields (model id, messages, stream flag, etc.).

### Files modified
- `types.ts`
- `models.ts`
- `models.generated.ts`
- `providers/simple-options.ts`
- `providers/anthropic.ts`
- `providers/openai-responses.ts`
- `providers/openai-completions.ts`

- `providers/google.ts`
- `providers/google-vertex.ts`
- `providers/google-gemini-cli.ts`
- `providers/amazon-bedrock.ts`
- `scripts/generate-models.ts`

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- Extra-body pass-through has to be read inside each provider's payload builder (pre-`onPayload` hook), which is core `pi-ai` territory; a coding-agent extension cannot reach into `pi-ai` provider payload construction.
- Opus 4.7 model metadata, xhigh capability detection, and adaptive thinking effort mapping all live in `pi-ai`. `supportsXhigh`, `supportsAdaptiveThinking`, and `mapThinkingLevelToEffort` are internal to the provider.
- Running `generate-models.ts` regenerates `models.generated.ts` from models.dev; the Opus 4.7 override block ensures the upstream regeneration keeps our entry.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- `scripts/generate-models.ts` Opus override block (lines around the 4.6 additions).
- `src/providers/anthropic.ts` `supportsAdaptiveThinking` / `mapThinkingLevelToEffort` / `AnthropicEffort`.
- `src/providers/simple-options.ts` (new exports).
- `src/models.ts` `supportsXhigh`.
- `src/types.ts` `StreamOptions.extraBody`.

## 2026-04-17 (follow-up) - "max" ThinkingLevel + tightened extraBody guards + Google `config` merge

### What changed and why
- Exposed Anthropic's native `"max"` effort through the unified `ThinkingLevel` surface: `StreamOptions.reasoning: "max"` maps to `max` on Opus 4.6/4.7, clamps to `high` on other adaptive models, and falls back to the `high` budget on budget-based Anthropic models. OpenAI-style providers clamp `max` to `xhigh` on xhigh-capable models (GPT-5.2/5.3/5.4) and to `high` otherwise via a new `clampMaxForOpenAI` helper.
- Extended the per-provider reserved-key sets so `extraBody` cannot stomp library-managed fields. New reservations include `metadata`, `temperature`, `store`, `stream_options`, `provider`, `providerOptions`, `tool_stream`, `prompt_cache_key`, `prompt_cache_retention`, `service_tier`, `promptMode`, `requestMetadata`. The Google reserved set now targets the inner `config` object (which the @google/genai SDK serializes as the HTTP request body) with `systemInstruction` / `tools` / `toolConfig` / `generationConfig` / `thinkingConfig` / `responseMimeType` / `responseSchema` / `cachedContent` / `abortSignal` / `httpOptions` reserved.
- Merged Google and Google Vertex `extraBody` into `params.config` instead of the top-level `GenerateContentParameters` so user-supplied fields actually reach the Gemini wire (the SDK does not serialize root-level unknown fields).
- Updated `adjustMaxTokensForThinking` / `clampReasoning` to accept the new `"max"` level without crashing on missing budget entries.

### Files modified (follow-up)
- `src/types.ts` (ThinkingLevel adds `"max"`)
- `src/providers/simple-options.ts` (added `clampMaxForOpenAI`, tightened reserved sets, Google reservations target `config`)
- `src/providers/anthropic.ts` (`mapThinkingLevelToEffort` native `max` case, JSDoc refresh, reserved keys `metadata` + `temperature`)
- `src/providers/openai-responses.ts`, `openai-completions.ts`, `openai-codex-responses.ts`, `azure-openai-responses.ts` (use `clampMaxForOpenAI` on xhigh-capable models)
- `src/providers/amazon-bedrock.ts` (budget table adds `max`, clamp `max` on budget-based path)
- `src/providers/google.ts`, `google-vertex.ts` (merge extraBody into `config`)

### Why the higher-level extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The `ThinkingLevel` union, provider effort mapping, and reserved-key sets all live inside `pi-ai`. Exposing `"max"` to the coding agent requires widening the shared union and updating every provider's payload builder and option-derivation logic.

### Expected merge conflict zones (follow-up)
- `src/types.ts` `ThinkingLevel` union.
- Each provider's `streamSimple<Provider>` reasoning mapping block.
- `src/providers/simple-options.ts` exported reserved-key sets.

# PR-008 Cleanup Receipt

This work is using code-yeongyu/lazycodex teammode.

UTC: 2026-06-24T11:36Z.

No intentionally retained adapter process, socket, port, tmux session, or temp
runtime was created by PR-008 verification. senpi QA scripts ran in isolated
sandboxes and reported the real auth file unchanged.

An untracked generated `.codegraph` symlink was removed from the checkout
because Biome followed it into a local daemon socket during `npm run check`.
The symlink was local tool state, not product code or committed evidence.

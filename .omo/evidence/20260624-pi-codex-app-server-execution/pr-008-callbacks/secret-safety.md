# PR-008 Secret Safety

This work is using code-yeongyu/lazycodex teammode.

- No raw secret-bearing logs, auth headers, cookies, API keys, or private
  credentials are included in committed evidence.
- `request_user_input` raw secret answers are forwarded to app-server only as
  callback responses; evidence rendering redacts secret answers to
  `[REDACTED]`.
- senpi QA common self-check, CLI smoke, and mock-loop all reported the real
  auth file unchanged.
- Process command arguments are not included in cleanup evidence.
